      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The real estate market has always been closely related to people's lives. 
        Utilizing Machine Learning to predict the market based on the existing dataset of the real 
        estate market has always been a hot topic. Massachusetts Housing Market Prediction Model is 
        aimed to predict the housing price in different areas in MA and provides insights and 
        recommendations for traders, researchers, and any interested parties.  
        <br><br>
        Our project used a dataset we collected and preprocessed. We chose five different algorithms,
        such as the traditional regression, ensemble learning, and neural networks. 
        Then we make a comprehensive comparison between different models built by these algorithms. 
      </p>
      <h2>2. Background and Previous Work</h2>
      <p>
        Building a precise tool to predict house prices has been a challenging topic in the real estate 
        industry because the estimation of a house price involves plenty of factors. 
        There are several tools that already exist for house price prediction, such as the House Price 
        Index used by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the neural Zestimate created by Zillow [1],[2]. 
        However, these tools are either inefficient or constructed based on the factors that only pertain 
        to the real estate properties themselves. Our MA Housing Market Prediction Model aims to predict 
        house values by incorporating additional features that were not previously considered in 
        the existing models. Our model will be specifically designed for house price prediction in Massachusetts
        and is dedicated to assisting individuals or cohorts who want to purchase, invest, or sell a home in MA.
        <br><br>
        In recent years, many studies have explored different machine learning algorithms for solving the
        house price prediction problem [3],[4],[5]. Interestingly, there are insufficient studies that 
        compare the efficiency between machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms for this 
        price prediction problem. Thus, in our study, we will make a comprehensive comparison between 
        classic regression algorithm, advanced regression techniques, and neural networks.  
      </p>
      <h2>3. Data Preprocessing </h2>
      <h3>3.1 Generating MA housing dataset & Data Cleaning</h3>
      <p>
        The USA Real Estate Dataset [6] was selected as the primary dataset because it contains city name and zip codes, 
        which we later used as an index to add the additional features. However, this dataset only partially contains 
        the features that we are interested in for building our models. Therefore, we conducted a thorough search and collected 
        the data of eight more features, including ‘crime index’, ‘people in poverty’, ‘people commute time’, ‘personal property tax rate’,
        ‘population density’, ‘school rating’, and ‘median household income’. We combined these data with the original dataset 
        to create our own MA housing dataset.  
        <br><br>
        To ensure data quality for building our models, we performed cleaning procedures by removing rows with missing values and 
        eliminating duplicate entries. Below is a summary of our dataset after the data cleaning process: 
        <br><br>
        Dataset size: [6157 rows x 16 columns] 
        <br><br>
        Description of the features: <br><br>  
        <b>'bed'</b>: the number of bedrooms in the house <br>
        <b>'bath':</b> the number of bathrooms in the house <br>
        <b>'acre_lot':</b> the lot area of the house <br>
        <b>'city':</b> the city name of where the house is located   <br>
        <b>'state':</b> the state name of where the house is located  <br>
        <b>'zip_code':</b> the zip code of where the house is located  <br>
        <b>'house_size':</b> the size of the house  <br>
        <b>'price':</b> the price of the house <br>
        <b>'crime_index':</b> the crime index is an indicator of the crime level in a region. 
         higher crime index value means more crime. <br>
        <b>'People_in_poverty':</b> percentage of people in poverty in a region. <br>
        <b>'People_commute_time':</b> mean travel time to work (minutes) in a region <br>
        <b>'School_rating':</b> the school rating of high school in a region. Rating score range is
         between 1 to 10. A higher rating score means the school is better.<br>
        <b>'Personal_property_tax_rate':</b> personal property tax rate in a region. <br>
        <b>'Population_density_per_city (population/sq mi)':</b> population density in a region.<br>
        <b>'Average Education Index ':</b> the education index is an indicator of the average education 
        level of the population. A higher education index value means more educated population. <br>
        <b>'Median Household Income ':</b> median household income in a region. <br><br>
        We dropped column 'city' and 'state' for later steps, because 'city' and 'zip_code' are similar indicators, and 'state' values are the same for all the examples.  
      </p>
      <h3>3.2 Exploration Analysis</h3>
      <h4>3.2.1 Eliminating outliers of each column</h4>
       <p>
      <br>
        Box plot of each feature: 
       </p>
       <!-- inset plots -->
       <img src="images/boxplot.png" alt="alternative_text">
       <p>
        The above box plots reveal that more than half of the features have outliers. Data of 'bed', 
        'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size' and 'price' are extremely skewed. Based on the box plots 
        we removed some outliers. And our dataset size was reduced to 4677 rows. 
        <br><br>
        To confirm the skewness of the data after the previous step, we calculated the skewness 
        of each column and found that there were still eight features with absolute skewness 
        greater than 0.5. To avoid any further decrease in our dataset size, we implemented 
        the Box-Cox transformation technique to adjust the skewness of the features in the table below. 
       </p>
       <!-- inset plots -->
       <img src="images/skew.png" alt="alternative_text">
      <h4>3.2.2 Correlation between each feature and the target</h4>
        <p>
        The correlation heatmap of the features and the target is presented below. 
        It indicates that all the features are correlated with the target ‘price’. Among all the features, 
        ‘bath’ has the most positive correlation with the house price, while ‘Personal_property_tax_rate’ has the most
        negative correlation with ‘price’. This implies that houses with a greater number of bathrooms tend to have higher prices.
        And the houses in the region with a higher personal property tax rate tend to have lower prices. 
        <br><br> 
        Besides, we observed that the regions with lower median household income and higher rates of people in poverty tend to 
        have lower ratings of school and higher rates of crime. And residents in these regions tend to have lower education attainments.    
        </p>

      <h3>3.3 Feature Scaling</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the significant differences in the scale of each variable, we normalized all the data to a common 
        range between 0 to 1. However, for ‘zip_code’, as it is a categorical feature, we created dummy variables to represent its valuse.  
      </p>
      <h2>4. Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning </h2>
      <!-- Content for the Challenges section goes here -->
      <p>
        Based on our research, we found that this regression problem can be solved through various
         kinds of algorithms. We were able to classify them into various categories of traditional, 
         advanced, and neural network algorithms.  
         <br><br>
        We ended up selecting the Ridge and Lasso regression algos for the traditional approach as 
        the normal linear regression was overfitting the model. Ridge and Lasso regression use L2 and L1
         regularization techniques respectively which help in stabilizing the coefficient estimates and 
         reducing overfitting. Also, on transforming the categorical data to a vector, we end up having
          many features, and these algos also help in feature selection by handling multicollinearity. 
        The only hyperparameter needed for these models is the regularization strength alpha. 
        After many iterations, we realized that the best performance was obtained with alpha = 10 
        for ridge regression and alpha = 0.000006 for lasso regression. 
        <br><br>
        For the advanced regression algos, we used the Random Forest and XGBoost regression techniques 
        as they came up as potentially good algorithms for our use case from our background research. 
        One of the reasons for selecting the Random Forest algorithm is that by aggregating multiple 
        decision trees, it reduces the risk of overfitting and variance, leading to more robust and 
        accurate predictions. It also does not require feature scaling, and automatically performs 
        ensemble averaging by combining predictions from multiple decision trees. XGBoost was also 
        selected because it reduces the risk of overfitting by combining multiple decision trees 
        (ensemble learning) and using both L1 and L2 regularization techniques. This leads to 
        higher predictive accuracy. The hyperparameter of the number of epochs was used in the 
        random forest case, and optimum results were found for 300 epochs. In the case of XGBoost,
         multiple hyperparameters were tuned and the best result was obtained with number of epochs 
         = 130, learning rate = 0.3, max depth of decision trees = 5, and regularization strength
          (alpha) = 0.4. 
        <br><br>
        Finally, we wanted to implement a neural network for this problem as it was a completely 
        different approach for house price prediction and because we studied it in class. Although 
        this approach is more situated for larger datasets and those using image, text or sequence 
        data, we wanted to see how the performance would be like. We build a 12 layer neural network
        with relu activation function for all layers except the last one. The first layer had 128 
        neurons and the remaining had 64 neurons except the last one that had just 1 for the output
        price prediction. The adam optimizer was used and best performance was obtained with batch
        size = 10 and number of epochs = 100. On average, training the neural network took more 
        time than the other algorithms.

      <h2>6. Algorithm Comparison Summary: </h2>
      <!-- inset plots -->
      <img src="images/comparison.png" alt="alternative_text">
      <ul>
      <li>The R2 scores across all models indicate that the model explains most of the variance 
          in the dependent variable since it is higher than 0.7 (1 being perfectly predicted). 
          This means that it can predict the data points with a high level of certainty. 
          In our experiment, the one with the higher R2 is considered preferable as it 
          is an indication of better predictive performance. We can see that XGBoost 
          achieves the highest R2 and therefore the preferred method for prediction using 
          our dataset based on R2 scores. </li>
    
      <li>Unlike the R2 score, the mean squared error (MAE) accuracy increases when the MAE 
          approaches 0. In this case, we can also see the best predictive model for our data is XGBoost </li>

      <li>As MAE, the closer our MSE gets to 0, the more accurate our models will predict our data. 
          We also notice these are not similar due to the square factor on MSE. As shown by the table,
           we can see XGBoost outperforming all other models. </li>
  
      <li>Derived from the MSE, the RMSE, we add the root square to the MSE to add additional sensitivity
          to outliners (even though we tried to decrease the amount during the pre-processing data phase).
          Based on our results, XGBoost comes on top and provides the user with the insight that using 
          this model could provide the most accurate predictions when considering prices in a house in
          the MA region.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>7. Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        We encountered many challenges while working on our project. First, we need to find 
        a topic that not only has practical significance, but also that our teammates all can 
        participate in and understand, and it is also within our ability to achieve. Another 
        challenge for us is to get our unique MA housing dataset due to the complexity of the raw dataset.
        We eliminated some features that do not work in the model from the raw dataset, added some 
        features collected by ourselves, and preprocessed some correlations, outliers, and skewness
        of the dataset. We also used a special way to transform categorical features (zip code or 
        city name) to a vector. The third challenge for us is to use the algorithms on the dataset
        to get the models. We need to be familiar with and can use coding to implement these algorithms. 
        There is lots of coding work in Google Colab for the project. 
        To improve the performance of the model, we repeatedly tuned the hyperparameters, 
        processed the dataset, and changed the architecture of the models. The most important 
        challenge is working collaboratively online. 
      </p>
      <h2>8. Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        From the inception of this project to the end, we have been able to learn a lot about 
        machine learning in general. Having done some background information, we were 
        able to understand the complexities of house price prediction and did our best 
        to get the highest performance we could. Some key concepts that we learned are 
        the importance of understanding the dataset and cleaning it to get better models, 
        realizing how different hyperparameters affect the algorithm performance and the 
        need for processing the features of the dataset. We believe that better models can 
        be made with work on ensemble learning combining these models we used and compared. 
        Another step would be to further optimize the hyperparameters as we were constrained 
        by time. Finally, we would like to thank the professor, fellow classmates and everyone
        else who helped us complete this project.
