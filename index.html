    <h1>Introduction<h1>
    The real estate market has always been closely related to people's lives. Utilizing Machine Learning to predict the market based on the existing dataset of the real estate market has always been a hot topic. Massachusetts Housing Market Prediction Model is aimed to predict the housing price in different areas in MA and provides insights and recommendations for traders, researchers, and any interested parties.  

Our project used a dataset we collected and preprocessed. We chose five different algorithms, such as the traditional regression, ensemble learning, and neural networks. Then we make a comprehensive comparison between different models built by these algorithms.
